What We Do
AI agents are powerful—but when they call tools, browse the web, or process user input, they’re open to prompt injection and other attacks.
HaliosAI gives you a lightweight, developer-friendly API to detect and block malicious prompts before they reach your model or tools.

Configurable Guardrails — Define safety rules that match your app’s context.

Seamless Integration — Works with LLM routers, firewalls, and popular agent frameworks.
